Average Localization Error (ALE) in sensor node localization process in WSNs Data Set

This data set can be used to test any regression-based machine learning algorithm. 
You can predict the ALE variable using four features.

Data Set Information:

This data contains 6 columns (107x6). The first four columns are features, 
namely anchor ratio, the transmission range of a sensor, node density (here no. of sensor nodes), 
and iteration count. 
The fifth column is ALE (predictand) and the last column is the standard deviation value
 (you may ignore this column if not interested in the error in ALE). 
This data set is generated from modified Cuckoo search simulations.
Anyone can use this data with proper acknowledgment/citation.

Attribute Information:

This data contains four features and one predictand.
Features are;
1. Anchor ratio
2. Transmission range (measured in meters)
3. Node density and
4. Iteration
The predictand is ALE (measured in meters)
