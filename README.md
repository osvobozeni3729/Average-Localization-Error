# Average-Localization-Error
This data contains 6 columns (107x6). The first four columns are features, namely anchor ratio, the transmission range of a sensor, node density (here no. of sensor nodes), and iteration count. The fifth column is ALE (predictand) and the last column is the standard deviation value (you may ignore this column if not interested in the error in ALE)
